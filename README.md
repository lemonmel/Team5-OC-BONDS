Start building at main content area (.main_content_container) at line 222
The main content area is wrapped with contaiener and row already.
So you should start building your UI by creating a new div that have .col & .mycontainer class

there're some example for different layouts such as covid19.php page


#Because we are currently using html, and not using the php to include header and footer, Thus all the header and footer is just copied and pasted and it might not consistent throughout the folders.

so please don't change the header and footer part. 
And if you have any cdn to add you can just add it and inform later

And we haven't setup the github collab flow. So for the frontend we just code ourself and send to leader who will compile it later.

After week 8, we might work on github and to develop a feature, pull from master branch and create a feature branch. After coding, commit it and make a pull request.
